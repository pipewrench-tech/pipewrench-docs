## The Onboarding Flow

Follow these three simple steps to transition from a new account to a fully branded sales platform.

=== "Step 1: Terms & Conditions"

    ### Setting the Rules
    The first step is defining how you do business. This ensures every Quote and Invoice is legally sound and sets clear expectations for your customers.

    * **Quotes:** Specify how many days your estimates stay valid (e.g., 7 days).
    * **Invoices:** Define your payment window so customers know exactly when money is due.
    * **Standard Terms:** These will be displayed by default on your rendered documents.

    

=== "Step 2: Payments"

    ### Getting Paid
    Pipewrech makes it easy for your customers to pay you by bank transfer. By adding your details here, they will be automatically formatted and displayed on your invoices.

    * **Bank Account:** Enter your Bank Name, Account Number, and Sort Code.
    * **Flexibility:** This step is **optional**. If you don't have your details handy, you can skip it and add them later in your settings.

    !!! warning "Pro Tip"
        You won't be able to display bank details on invoices until an account is linked to your Pipewrech profile.

    

=== "Step 3: Personalisation"

    ### Look the Part
    This is where your documents come to life. Adding your branding ensures your proposals look like a premium extension of your business.

    * **Document Accent Colour:** Use the color picker to select your brand's primary color. This is used for headings and buttons on your PDFs.
    * **Company Logo:** Upload a high-resolution PNG or JPG. We recommend a version that looks great on both light and dark backgrounds.

## Managing Your Details Later

If your business details change or you skipped a step during the initial setup, you can update everything from within the app from the  **Settings** menu in the main navigation   .

### To update your Invoice or Bank settings:
1. Open the **Settings** menu from the main navigation.
2. Navigate to the **Invoices** tab.
3. Here you can add new payment accounts or refine your standard terms and conditions.
